# Automated-Resume-Keyword-Extractor-1
This mini project template helps in identifying important keywords from a resume to shortlist the candidates.

I have used simple plain text as a input.

Scope for future development:

1. Can convert the script into a web-based tool (Flask, Streamlit).
2. Can improve different text format resume, e.g. PDF, Word documents by using pdfminer or python-docx.
3. For more advance skills extraction, can use TF-IDF or spaCy
